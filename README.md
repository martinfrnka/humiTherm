# humiTherm
Thermal and humidity measurement tool using Raspberry Pi

This project is focused on creating digital measurement tool for continuous
monitoring of temperature and humidity in a room. Actual values should be 
displayed on embedded LCD screen and also periodically read by zabbix agent.

The measurement of temperature and humidity is done using digital sensor DHT22
connected to Raspberry Pi 3.

# Wiring DHT22 to Raspberry Pi

# program for reading measurements
